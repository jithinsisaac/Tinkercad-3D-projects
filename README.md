3D Projects implemented while learning & experimenting with Tinkercad by Autodesk

Tinkercad is a free 3D modeling web application by Autodesk, extremely intuitive to use. Time to prototype is reduced drastically by using Tinkercad.

Although it is a good tool for initial understanding of 3D models, would highly recommend using FOSS, especially **FreeCAD for 3D modeling**. As is the case with a lot of applications by Autodesk (Fusion 360, Eagle etc.), we never know when they will pull the plug on tinkercad and make it a paid product!
